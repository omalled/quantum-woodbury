A near-term quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations based on the Woodbury identity
===============================

Description
-----------

This code utilizes the [Woodbury identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity) to solve linear systems of equations on a quantum computer. At present, it currently supports a limited subset of the Woodbury identity.
